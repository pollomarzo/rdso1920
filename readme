some exam solutions for davoli's course at UNIBO.
simplest ones are only in pseudocode. pseudocode is sometimes straight python. python implementations, where present, are (mostly) correct, and small testing functions are included. we start by writing pseudocode, mentally test it, then move onto python: python versions are always closer (i hope) to the solution.
solved mainly by mattia and paolo, sometimes with help
